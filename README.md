# Gerbil Time Tracker

Gerbil is a minimalist personal time tracker inspired by [Project Hamster](https://github.com/projecthamster/hamster). It doesn't have as many features, Gerbil aims to be simple and quick to use.

The application is currently in beta.

## Installation

To install Gerbil head over to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/kaisentlaia/gerbil-time-tracker/releases) and download either the Windows installer, the Linux *.deb package or the appropriate portable version for your OS. 

## Usage

Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/kaisentlaia/gerbil-time-tracker/wiki) for more inforation about Gerbil usage.

## Backup

All the tracking data is saved automatically in the following file:

### Linux

```
/home/user/.config/gerbil-time-tracker/config.json
```

### Windows

```
/%appdata%/gerbil-time-tracker/config.json
```

## Development

Gerbil has been developed using Angular 9.1.13 and Electron. The application has not been tested with other Angular versions, so it's suggested to use 9.1.13 for development.
